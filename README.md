# spellcheck
Spellchecker experiment

Goal:
- Application: preprocess text to improve search and classification/clustering performance
- Good enough for classification (where the whole system does not depend only on the accuracy of spell checker)
- Good enough for search (where other edit distance and proximity search can be applied to improve usability)
- Fast enough to process large amount of text (corpus of 1 GB text in couple minutes)

Non-goal (yet):
- Good enough for linguistic analysis
